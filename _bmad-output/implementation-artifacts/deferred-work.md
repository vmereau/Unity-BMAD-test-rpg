- **Thin world items are hard to focus/pick up** — `ItemAssetBuilder` fits the BoxCollider exactly to the renderer
  bounds (lockpick: 0.15 × 0.019 × 0.045 m). Consider a minimum collider thickness (or a separate trigger/interaction
  collider) for thin items; tune after a play test. Also applies to `WeaponCreatorWindow` world prefabs, which
  additionally lack `InteractionHighlight` (pre-existing).

- **`NpcShopEditor` scene path untested** (from spec-npc-shop-dialogue-command review) — only the pure
  `ApplyStockChange` is covered. `SetStock` / `FindInstances` / dirty-scene + Play-mode refusal / `SerializedProperty`
  write-back have no automated test; would need a temp scene with an `Entity_base` instance in an EditMode test.
